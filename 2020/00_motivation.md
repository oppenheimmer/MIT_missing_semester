## Why this class?

During a traditional Computer Science program, one will take plenty of advanced classes:
From _Operating Systems_ and _Programming Languages_, to _Machine Learning_. But at many institutions there is one essential topic that is rarely covered:
_Computing ecosystem literacy_.

Computers were built to automate tasks, yet people often perform repetitive tasks by hand or fail to take full advantage of powerful tools at disposal. In the best case, these result in inefficiencies and wasted time; in the worst case, these could result in data loss, corruption etc. We can be a lot more efficient in how we use computers, by using many tools better.

The standard curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing education. This course attempts to bridge some gaps. Topics include:

- **Command shell**: To automate the boring, repetitive tasks with aliases, scripts and build systems.

- **Version control**: To use version control properly & take advantage of it to save work from disaster, collaborate with others and quickly find problematic changes.

- **Text editing**: To use editing from command line / vim, both locally and remotely, and take advantage of advanced editor features.

- **Remote machines**: To work with SSH keys and terminal multiplexing.

- **Finding files**: Quickly and efficiently look for the files.

- **Data wrangling**: Quickly modify, view, parse, plot and compute over data and files from the command line.

- **Virtual machines**: Try out new systems and isolate projects, keeping machine clean & tidy.

- **Security**: Effectively and efficiently manage computer security. Basics
of encryption, computer network security etc.
